# AndroidTV and the Leanback UI
http://www.meetup.com/GDGAuckland/events/232183469/
My sample app from the GDG Auckland meetup

This is a sample Cordova app built to demo Cordova development with Visual Studio 2015.
It uses data from the Marvel API http://developer.marvel.com/docs (some offline data from the API as well) and some cordova plugins (referrenced below).
